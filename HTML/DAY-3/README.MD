# Day 3 - Simple Portfolio Page

## 📝 Description
This is my Day 3 HTML practice project – a simple portfolio webpage.  
It includes different sections: Home, Projects, Skills, and Contact.  
Navigation is added using anchor (`<a>`) links to scroll to each section.

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to use internal links with `id` and `href="#id"`
- Page layout using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Navigation with `<nav>` and anchor tags
